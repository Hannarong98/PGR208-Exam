    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.
    See this page for more information:
   https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started
    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    Note: This resource is used for the debug build target. Update this file if you just want to run
    the demo app.
